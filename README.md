# sia-coldstorage

sia-coldstorage is a utility that generates a seed and a collection of addresses for a Sia wallet, without the blockchain. This is useful for creating 'cold wallets'; you can run this utility on an airgapped machine, write down the seed and the addresses, and send coins safely to any of the addresses without having to worry about malware stealing your coins. You can use Sia to restore the seed and spend the funds at any time.

## USAGE

Download the latest release for your platform, then double click the
`sia-coldstorage` binary. This will generate your seed and addresses, opening
up a page in your web browser to display them. Ideally, you would run this on a
system that was very secure, i.e. an airgapped LiveCD.
